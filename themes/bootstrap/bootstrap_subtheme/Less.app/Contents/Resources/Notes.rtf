\f0\fs20 \cf0 Things to do:\
\
1. Check what happens when we DELETE a .less file that we're watching with auto-compile. Pretty sure that's going to fail in an ugly way.\
\
2. Look into the loophole with path validation and adding a less file at, say, ~/Documents/file.less. May need more specific error messages.}
